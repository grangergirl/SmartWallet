# SmartWallet

This is the companion app for a physical wallet that can detect the denomination of currency notes inserted/removed from the wallet. The denomination is detected using color sensors and the insertion/removal is detected using IR sensors. The whole setup is implemented using Arduino board, which communicates with the app using bluetooth.
